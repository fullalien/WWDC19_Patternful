 #### What is L-System?
 L-System is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar, and it was introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer.
 
 An L-System consists of an **alphabet** of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production **rules** that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial **axiom** string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures.
 
 It can be used to generate **self-similar fractals**.
