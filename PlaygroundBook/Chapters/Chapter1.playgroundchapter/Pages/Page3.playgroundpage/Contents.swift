 ### Thank You for Using My Playground
 It's time to say goodbye here. This page does not have any variables that can be changed. It's just a simple page to show what made me to create this playground, and what inspired me.
 
 You may wanna know how the top and bottom graphics are drawn, below is the `axiom`, `rule` and `deep` that I used.

/*:
 I got a lot of fun building all of this, and I found many amazing graphics, this is just one of them. I didn't do much, I just modified the `axiom`, `rule` and `deep`. Before I draw it out, I'll never know what it's.
 
 In a word, **blow minds, everything is possible**.
 
 Hope you enjoy it! ðŸ¥³
